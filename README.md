My attempt to write a wc in rust. Focusing on book style text files (not xml, code, html, etc).

Using hyperfine to benchmark vs WC.

Currently only a naive rust implementation exists.


# TODO

- Script download of moby dick 
- write up benchmark stuff
- Start performance tuning in rust (starting with Rayon parallel)
- Write tests to compare WC and rust output

Benchmark will download KJV bible
